 LINUX LOGO 0.2 -- Creates a Nifty Logo With some System Info - 10 July 1997
     by Vince Weaver (weave@eng.umd.edu, http://www.glue.umd.edu/~weave )

There is always controvery on the linux-kernel mailing list about an x86 
penguin logo on bootup.  I always thought this would be neat too, and set
out to program one, but I lack the skills to integrate something like that
into the kernel.

I did however manage to make this program that puts a crude ANSI picture of
a penguin on the screen, as well as show some main system info.

USES:
  BOOT UP PENGUIN: just stick "/usr/local/bin/linux_logo" in an rc file.
     [/etc/rc.d/rc.M is a good place if you are running Slackware.  Place
      it right above where sendmail is run because that creates a pause.]
  
  MOTD: You could even have people get this at the login prompt.  This
        would take some configuring of /etc/rc.d/rc.S but it is possible.
      
  FUN:  It is just cool to run it now and then.
  
  
USAGE:
  The file is ANSI escape sequences, so it should work OK with most terminals.
 
BUGS:   
  Not tested with non-x86 systems.
  Not SMP concious.  It would be nice to show multiple CPU info, but I don't
                     have a SMP box to work with.
   
 The image was created using the logo.xpm from the Linux distribution,
     ppm2ansi by Carsten Haitzler -- http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~s2154962/
     and was hand edited using THEDRAW under dosemu 0.66.7
