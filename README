   LINUX_LOGO 1.06 -- Shows a Logo With some System Info - 12 February 1998
     by Vince Weaver (weave@eng.umd.edu, http://www.glue.umd.edu/~weave )

       SUPPORTS Linux, SMP, Atari m68k, and even some non-Linux OS's

HISTORY: 
  
   Back in the summer of '97 there was a recurring topic on the linux-kernel
   list about having a "boot-up" penguin in the kernel.  There were many 
   arguments back and forth, but eventually the primary consensus was that
   this would be better done in user-space.  [though with the advent
   of GGI, etc, a graphical approach may become standard.  Patches did
   float around of a Vga-font hack to get a penguin...]
   
   So using a ppm to ansi converter from Rasterman [www.rasterman.com],
   a trial version of THEDRAW under DosEmu, and just some talents left
   over from my Ansi-art BBS days I hacked together a rough likeness
   of Ewing's Linux Penguin.  I added some system info from /proc, and
   linux_logo was born.
   
   The program itself has grown more "feature-full" as people around the
   world sent in their patches.  The newer versions are primarily minor
   cosmetic fixes.  But I get a lot of positive feedback from this tiny
   little program I created one summer day........

POTENTIAL USES FOR linux_logo
----------------------------------------------------------------------->

  BOOT UP PENGUIN: just stick "/usr/local/bin/linux_logo" in an rc file.
     [/etc/rc.d/rc.M is a good place if you are running Slackware.  Place
      it right above where sendmail causes a pause.]
  
  MOTD/LOGIN: You can have the penguin appear at the login prompt.  
        Add the following lines to /etc/rc.d/rc.S [in slackware] 
        or to /etc/rc.d/rc.local [OpenLinux]
	
  /usr/local/bin/linux_logo > /etc/issue
  /usr/local/bin/linux_logo > /etc/issue.net
  
        and the penguin appears at all the login prompts, even remote ones.
        
  REDHAT LOGIN: Here is how to do the above with a Redhat distribution.
         [thanks to Esperandi]
	 	 
	 "I love your Penguin Linux Logo login thing.  It only took me a couple
	 minutes but I figured out how to get it working with Red Hãt and its
	 rc files.  I was kinda new to Red Hat, having used Slackware for a 
	 billion years, and the rc files were totally different.  But I found
	 the best way to implement the penguin quite beautifully was to go 
	 into the rc.local files go down to the bottom, and above the line
	 that reads:
	 
	     echo "" > /etc/issue

         Insert this line:
             /usr/bin/linux_logo > /etc/issue

         and then change the echo line after it to:
             echo "" >> /etc/issue
	 
  NETWORK LOGIN:
        Note: for platforms that do not have color ansi telnet connections
	you might want to use the new "linux_logo -a" option.  This gives
	a plain ascii [though less exciting and uglier] output.  However
	boring telnet clients like win95's can then see the Penguin.  To
	add this functionality, follow the above instructions, but instead
	of:
	      /usr/local/bin/linux_logo > /etc/issue.net
	use the following in the appropriate place
	      /usr/local/bin/linux_logo -a > /etc/issue.net
	 
  PENGUIN PORT: You can set up a port on your Linux box to answer connections
         with the Penguin! 
	 
         Add the following line to /etc/services
	     penguin         1234/tcp        penguin
	     
	 Add the following line to /etc/inetd.conf
	    penguin stream  tcp     nowait  root   /usr/local/bin/linux_logo
	    
         Restart inetd (killall -HUP inetd) and you have it!!
	 
	 Locally "telnet your.host penguin" will do it.  From other machines
	 you will need the port number ("telnet your.host 1234").. it is easy
	 to customize.. just pick a port number and away you go!
 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------->
 INSTALLING linux_logo
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------->
 
    untar and uncompress the file
        tar -xzvf linux_logo-1.06.tar.gz
	
    enter the directory
        cd linux_logo-1.06
	
    edit the Makefile and be sure everything is set up the way you want.
    [on stock Linux systems it should work without any changes]
    
    compile the program
        make
	
    you can install it by hand
        cp linux_logo /usr/local/bin
	
    "make install" will do this for you.  You can place it anywhere you want,
    but /usr/local/bin is as good a place as any.

USAGE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------->

USAGE:   linux_logo [-n] [-p] [-o Num] [-s] [-v] [-h]
         [-n] -- toggle periods off [may make output look better/cleaner]
         [-p] -- preserve cursor location
         [-o Num] offset output by Num spaces to the right
         [-s] -- skip Bogomips [speeds up display on non-Linux platforms]
         [-v] -- version information
         [-h] -- this help screen

--------------------------------------------------------------------------->
TROUBLESHOOTING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------->

Know bugs: 
  
      Will not support >9 CPU SMP machines currently.
      
      Different architectures have odd /proc files.  If you send me
      a copy of relevant files (/proc/cpuinfo and /proc/version usually)
      I can see about adding support.
      
      On non-Linux platforms the BogoMips check can be quite slow.  To skip
         it use "linux_logo -s"
      
      To make easy updated to ansi files with difficult editors, 
         the combination ^[ is read as the ESC code (#27 decimal)
	 so this combination cannot be used in a picture.

TOOLS TO CREATE OTHER LOGOS
------------------------------------------------------------------------>
     The image was created using the logo.xpm from the Linux distribution,
     ppm2ansi by Carsten Haitzler -- http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~s2154962/
     and was hand edited using THEDRAW under dosemu 0.66.7
     
     Another good ansi editor [under development] from Adam Lackorzynski
     can be obtained at http://www.inf.tu-dresden.de/~al10/aae-0.01.tar.gz

THANKS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------->

   Many thanks to the people sending in patches and /proc/cpuinfo entries.
   Without you linux_logo wouldn't work on many machines.
   
   Also many Thanks to Marie Prosser who is always there for me.
