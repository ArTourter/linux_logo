- configure scripts?  I tried this, but it just bloated the sourcecode
    just to detect gcc/cc and architecture stuff.  For now I think the
    makefiles are working ok.
  
- Have a "model" option, so that on non-intel architectures it defaults
    to something like
       "Amiga 3000 with one 49.7Mhz 68040 Processor" instead of
       "One 49.7Mhz Amiga 68040 Processor"
    Same problem on MIPS

- possibly create a "libcpuinfo" to handle the above?

- re-write the parse code to be more /proc/cpuinfo fault tolerant...

- fix the Banner/Classic mode options to not be specific to one or the other.

- Support for utmp uptime support

  [this is possible.  Don't have time to code it right now however.. would
   want some-sort of override switch to overcome it too]
