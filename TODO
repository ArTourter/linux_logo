- make own version of getopt

- configure scripts?  I tried this, but it just bloated the sourcecode
    just to detect gcc/cc and architecture stuff.  For now I think the
    makefiles are working ok.
  
- Have architecture-specific default sysinfo output?
  That way archs like m68k that have extra info [like Amiga, Atari, Mac]
  can display this w/o adding hacks to make it look proper on archs
  w/o such info [ix86]
  
- fix the Banner/Classic mode options to not be specific to one or the other.

  [this is possible.  Don't have time to code it right now however.. would
   want some-sort of override switch to overcome it too]

- see the ./libsysinfo directory for sysinfo stuff
