Things possibly to do:  

- a "-no_escape" switch to completely skip escape sequences for dumb
  terminals?
- a "color" ascii art so that it looks ok on windows telnet but also on linux?
- better ascii art?

- regular ascii art for non-linux platforms.
- autoconfigure?

- what to do when nonexistent params are used
  I think ignoring is just ok
- what to do on a negative offset, is ignored right now
- a limitation for the offset would be also cool so that the penguin isn't
  destroyed if offset is to big
  but this thing is IMO a bit tricky because you need the width of the
  display
  and to get that width, I think, you've to use ncurses or
  is there another possibility to get this value
- maybe you could put an exit into help_message because it is always
  used as "help_message(...); return 1; ", the code would get smaller
