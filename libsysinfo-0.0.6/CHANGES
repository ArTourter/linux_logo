4 March 2001
+ Completed the new, separate libsysinfo stuff, splitting it off
  from linux_logo
  
27 March 2001
+ Added minimal SunOS [Solaris] support.  It compiles and displays
  mostly empty strings.

3 April 2001
+ You can do a "make shared" to get a .so linux shared library.
  It works, but I am sure it's not as robust as a shared lib
  should be.

30 April 2001
+ Fix from Matt <madmatt@bits.bris.ac.uk> so that linux-sparc cpuinfo
  will be compiled properly.

7 June 2001
+ Change to makefile so it doesn't depend on symlinks.  But instead
  it depends on "uname" existing.

22 October 2001
+ Fix "arch.h" so things actually work for non-ix86 architectures.
  Thanks to Ken Moffat <ken@kenmoffat.uklinux.net>
+ Add support for ia64 architecture thanks to Ludo
  <lfrancois@mandrakesoft.com>

28 October 2001
+ Fix Cyrix Geode bug
+ Fix obscure megahertz reporting bug

5 November 2001
+ Fix power-pc G4 printing (thanks to Nate Godin <nate@WPI.EDU> )

4 February 2002
+ Fix Athlon XP to be printed properly.  Should we detect MP as well?
  Should we do something with their fake MHz values (1600+)?
+ Better Linux memory detection using /proc/iomem with the old ways
  as fallbacks.  Thanks to Sitsofe Wheeler <sits@sucs.swan.ac.uk>
  for this nice patch

5 February 2002
+ Add new "Geode by NSC" cpuinfo
+ Fix support for chips with Celeron in the name
+ Added "get_arch_specifig_mem_info()" function, and
  openprom sparc mem checking mostly based on patches
  from Ben Collins <bmc@visi.net>
+ Bump version number to 0.0.4 to make tracking any mem
  related problems easier.

11 February 2002
+ Ran my "test_proc compliance tests" and did some minor fixups
  in the alpha, sparc, and ix86 "via" department.
+ Added pretty printing for m68k

14 February 2002
+ Fix so RAM over 2GB doesn't go negative.
  Thanks to Andreas S. Krebs <andreas.krebs@sap.com> for helping debug this.
  
10 March 2002
+ Reverted sparc PROM code because it doesn't seem to work.
+ Added support for Pentium 4 processors

13 March 2002
+ Fix Athlon XP's without a space in them

14 July 2002
+ Run through new batch of cpuinfo files, fixing anything needing fixed.
+ Added cris, s390, sh3, and vax Linux architectures
