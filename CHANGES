8 JULY 1997
+ Came up with the Idea
+ Converted the logo.xpm file to ANSI using ppm2ansi and xv
+ Fixed up the picture with THEDRAW under DOSEMU 0.66.7
+ Combined into a C program using jed.

9 JULY 1997
+ Figured out the tricky proc stuff (very inelegant)
+ Released version 0.1

10 JULY 1997
+ Fixed it so it looks better on a white background (standard rxvt or xterm)
+ Released version 0.2
+ Added documentation on how to add a "penguin port" to telnet into

14 JULY 1997
+ Return for weekend to find lots of feedback on this program.
+ Started adding updates.
+ Cleaned up output routines, added SMP and Atari support, and cleaned
  up the code in general.
+ Added a command line options. -v (version) -h (help) and -n (turn off
  periods in the output)
+ Released version 0.4 to my website [0.3 was a never released minor bugfix]

15 JULY 1997
+ Start on version 0.5
+ Really start modularizing.  Decide to make it completely platform
  independent.

16 JULY 1997
+ Finished modularization
+ Added -o option to print with offset
+ Finished cross-platform support (with a lot of #ifdef s)
+ Added IRIX and Default UNIX outputs
+ Added -s option to skip bogomips check on non-Linux OS's
+ Released version 0.6

18 JULY 1997
+ Got improved Atari m68k Code from Christian Marillat
+ Removed extraneous ^[ combination from the ansi .h files
  (so a cat of the header file shows the picture)
+ Released version 1.0 at sunsite and my site (no there is no 0.7-0.9
  ... the improvements were so drastic I thought it deserved a full
  version number).

25 JULY 1997
+ Fixed some typos in the README (thanks to Esperandi)
+ Ran doc files through ispell .. i didn't realize it was that bad ;)
+ Fixed handling of the -o option when a number doesn't follow
  (before resulted in seg-fault). (thanks to Adam Lackorzynski) 
+ Re-released as version 1.01

4 AUGUST 1997
+ Worked some more on the -o problem (again many thanks to Adam Lackorzynski)
  should not give any more problems.

5 AUGUST 1997
+ Added a TODO file
+ Added an exit() call to the help section, and removed some return 1; s
+ Fixed a minor bug with SGI getcpuinfo.
+ Put version 1.02 at my site (for some reason I forgot to put 1.01 there)  

6 FEBRUARY 1998
+ A few extremely minor bugs/typos fixed over the past months.
+ Added better support for K6-chips [I recently upgraded to one ;)] and
  the newer kernels.
+ Package up version 1.04 and release for test to UM-LUG

11 FEBRUARY 1998
+ Added "plain ascii" penguin and -a option to display it.
  [thanks to <nelson@media.mit.edu>] for getting me started on this one.
+ Fixed URL in the -h option
+ Make appropriate updates
+ Added OpenLinux instructions to Readme [thanks to <heaney@zombie.ncsc.mil>]
+ Released 1.05

12 FEBRUARY 1998
+ Found bug in 1.05 [% signs not work well in /etc/issue.net  ... they are
  escaped... ugh] so released 1.06
+ UGH! Uploaded 1.06 as ASCII instead of BIN at sunsite by mistake.  Changed
  version of package to 1.07 but leave everything as 1.06 ;)  yes I'm lazy
  
19 FEBRUARY 1998
+ Added Cyrix 6x86 support [thanks to <adam@princeton.edu>]
+ Changed to read the vendor_id to report vendor.  Idea also thanks to 
  <adam@princeton.edu>
  
13 MARCH 1998
+ Added minimal AIX port [thanks to Thomas Grewe]
+ Added indredible Banner support!  "linux_logo -banner"
  Much thanks to Albert Lai <aylai@unixg.ubc.ca>
+ Also added "-rX" option to change the character in banner, and 
  "-w Num" which changes width [all under banner]  
+ Made old linux_logo look "linux_logo -classic"
+ Modularized the getsysinfo.c files.  Trying to follow all the #ifdef
  statements was getting confusing.
+ Included a nice "further info" file from Tony Nugent <T.Nugent@sct.gu.edu.au>
+ Bunch of other stuff to get ready for release
+ Released version 2.00

16 APRIL 1998
+ Finally had time to work on things again.
+ Thanks to Joerg Berg <joerg@joberg.snafu.de> linux-alpha support should
  work.
+ I also rearranged the "sysinfo.c" file.  It now relies on pre-processor
  magic, but simplified the Makefile a lot.
+ Zipped up version 2.0.1

13 May 1998
+ Fixed it so that command line paramaters were passed to the relevant
  modules.  This had been broken for some time; thanks to
  <mengmeng@earthling.net> for pointing this out.
+ The boot-logo flamewar has resumed on linux-kernel, so I think I will
  zip up and get 2.0.2 ready to announce....
  
27 May 1998
+ Finally released 2.0.2.  Posted announcements to freshmeat.net and c.o.l.a.

28 May 1998
+ Got a lot of feedback due to the announcement on freshmeat.net.
+ Added -f option to clear screen.. thanks to Sean Kelly <smkelly@zombie.org>
  for the suggestion.
+ Fixed a typo in sysinfo_{default,aix}.c thanks to zap <zap@arosnet.se>
+ Added a section to the README about having fun with the -R option
+ Increased the size of some buffers so that long cpu names [especially
  Pentium II ones] don't overflow.  [Thanks to Caleb Epstein
  <epstein_caleb_unix@jpmorgan.com> and Steve <steve@steve.paradise.net.nz> 
  for reporting this problem].
+ Changed the 'penguin_port' in the README to 54321.  Thanks to 
  David Nedrow <dnedrow@usa.net> for letting me know that port 1234
  has a reserved meaning and that a higher numbered port would be better.
+ Added Linux-Sparc support with the help of Raymond Wu <rwu@ml.com>

1 June 1998
+ Added better BogoMips reporting for Sparc64 [thanks to "Eddie C. Dost"
  <ecd@skynet.be>]

3 June 1998
+ Fixed typo in sysinfo.c thanks to Rod Begbie <rod@begbie.com>

4 June 1998
+ Fixed problem where if there was no vendor it would include extrneous
  space in the sysinfo ouput.  Thanks to report from Mark Lundeberg
  <aa026@pgfn.bc.ca>
+ added contrib directory for possible future logos
+ improved AIX support thanks to Jochen Stein <jst@writeme.com>

18 June 1998
+ Added -k switch to enable chaning of backround shape independently of
  foreground.  Thanks to Alexandre Aufrere <alexandre.aufrere@bigfoot.com>
+ Fixed a bug on showing MMX pentiums with 2.0.34?

9 July 1998
+ Someone reported 2.03 to freshmeat although it wasn't quite an official
  "Announce to the world" release.  So I got to working on this a bit.
+ Made a patch to allow adding the linux_logo [in color] to the linux kernel.
  I think the logo should remain user_space, but people kept whining how ugly
  the text logos were with fbcon.  Oddly, I got no response for my patch.
  None at all.  It can be obtained at 
  http://www.ee.umd.edu/~weave/color-vga-linux-logo.patch
  And is against 2.1.108 with some of Geert's fbcon fixes.
+ Messed with the directory structure some more, moving the "Samples" to the
  ./samples directory.
+ Restructured source to use global variables instead of paramater passing.
  Made code much easier to follow and smaller.
+ Now default behavior is customizable by editing the "defaults.h" file.
+ Added the -l and -g switches to disable sysinfo and logo respectively.
+ Fixed up the README file a lot.
+ Packed up 2.05 and released it.

10 July 1998
+ Improved support for K6 on 2.0.34 so it actually works now.
+ Added support for Centaur and "Transmeta" ;) Chips.
  Note... The transmeta thing is a joke.  I have no clue if they are
  making Intel-type chips.
+ Packaged up a "2.05a" version.

13 July 1998
+ Fixed a bug where the -k and -x options didn't work.  UGH.  Thanks to my
  friend John, at whose house I figured out the problem.
+ Fixed it so it displays non-cpuid [ <486] chips sort of right under
  2.1.x series kernels.  Need to test this on 2.0.x series kernels to see
  if I broke anything....
+ Packed up and released as "2.05b"
+ Added -u uptime option.  Suggested by many people, including 
  David Christensson <david.christensson@swipnet.se>,
  Allan Joergensen <dw@null.dk>, and my friend John C. <clemej@rpi.edu>
  ** NOTE ** involved changes to many of the architecture specific files.
  PLEASE TEST AND REPORT ANY BUGS.
+ Made it so the -ascii switch really doesn't display any ESC characters.
+ Removed a lot of redundant code.
+ Updated CHANGES and TODO and BUGS files.
+ Will release "2.06" on my web-site temporarily.

14 July 1998
+ Got everything ready for the 2.07 release.  Trying not to forget anything
  [I always do anyway].

29 July 1998
+ Finally got around to uploading the newest version to sunsite and reporting
  it at freshmeat. 
+ Had forgotten to take the "cpuinfo" test file out.  UGH.
+ Added a fix for PentiumII's on linux 2.0.x [with cpuinfo sent by
  <xanni@xanadu.net>.  I wish I had access to more machines to test this on;
  fixing one always risks breaking another.  If only I kept all those
  /proc/cpuinfo's people sent me and had an automated parser... much more
  trouble than it'd be worth.  Oh well.
  
31 July 1998
+ Added preliminary PowerPC support thanks to a /proc/cpuinfo sent in by
  Beecher Greenman <rbg6038@ritvax.isc.rit.edu>
+ Fixed a centering bug in banner mode that had been bothering me for a while.
  A "+4" should have been a "+2"
+ Re-changed that to "+3", after much trial and error, deciding it was the 
  value that made odd-sized strings come out the best in banner mode.
+ Went through sysinfo_*.c, updating the files, making sure they used BUFSIZ
  and making sure uninitialized strings won't give garbage on the wrong
  architecture.

13 August 1998
+ Don't really have time to work on linux_logo, but since everone keeps
  sending me e-mail about it, why not ;)
+ Fixed K6 printing on 2.0.36p5 [Ugh, why are they always changing this].
  Actually it was reported this kernel causes 'linux_logo -a' to print blank
  spaces for ever.  This is because one of the sysinfo lines was >80, so the
  centering code ended up doing a loop to a negative number [that wrapped to
  2^31], causing lots of bad effects.  Thanks to Nate Godin <nate@WPI.EDU> 
  for the report.
+ Added information to the README for adding linux_logo to SUSE linux systems.
  Thanks to Rodolfo Pilas <rodolfo@linux.org.uy>.
  
1 September 1998
+ Back at school.  Trying to merge stuff up the best I can.
+ Integrated [with some changes] a patch sent by Aleksey Makarov
  <makarov@iitam.omsk.net.ru>.  This changed the command-line parsing
  to the get_opt() command, plus added the -t command line option
  to print arbitrary text.
+ Shortened the -ascii -banner and -classic commands to -a,-b, and -c.
  The old ones still work, but this is more "correct".  I will probably
  add --ascii --banner and --classic at some point.
+ Updates the -t option to work with classic mode, substantially
  re-structuring the classic mode code.  
+ Alexander Klink <ak@wireworm.com> sent me a cool picture of linux_logo
  on a vt102.  See the linux_logo page [www.ee.umd.edu/~weave/vmwprod]
  for a copy of the picture.
+ Found out that there is a debian package of linux_logo, and it even
  has its own maintainer, Steve Kostecke <steve@kostecke.net>.
  Anyway he sent in some patches, including a man page and some ppc
  fixes, so I merged them in as well.
  
5 September 1998
+ Fixed it so the -f and -g options work together [thanks to Gabriel Grundin 
  <gabbe@linux.nu> for this one.
+ Kernel 2.1.120 messed up /proc/cpuinfo once again.  Work-around added.
  Thanks to adam@cc934578-a.ewndsr1.nj.home.com for the help.
  
11 September 1998
+ After numerous reports of linux_logo being broken for > 2.1.120 I 
  released 2.10

13 September 1998
+ Fixed it so K6-2 machines look ok [at least on 2.0.35].

25 September 1998
+ Started integrating some info that Alex Buell
  <alex.buell@tahallah.demon.co.uk> kindly provided into the /proc/cpuinfo
  parsing code.

2 October 1998
+ After awful week of exams, decided to work on linux_logo a bit ;)
+ Added a new "-x" option that uses a new charachter '@' in the
  banner.h file to indicate characters that can be dropped in order
  to get a "narrower" logo.  This was a problem with some people where
  the issue.net file being 80chars caused problems.. hopefully this fixes
  that.
+ Added "-y" loadaverage support.  Also re-modularized the banner output
  code.  Thanks to Anders Rundegren <anders@rundegren.com> for sending the
  patch my way.
+ Packed up 2.11.  Won't announce to the world until I do a few beta-tests
  first.
+ Realized using '@' as the character above screwed up the ascii output.
  Changed it to `
+ Found another mistake where I forgot to add ` s to ascii_banner.h

30 October 1998
+ Have been busy busy busy busy doing other stuff.  Finally had time to
  work on linux_logo and try to get back to the people who had sent me
  stuff the last month.
+ Added an "-e" option.  This makes it easier for me to check problems
  with other people's /proc/cpuinfo files that they send me.  It can also
  be used, I suppose, to trick linux_logo into thinking you have a better
  computer ;)
+ Tested the new version with some of the assorted cpuinfo files 
  Alex Buell sent me.
+ Michael Somos <somos@grail.cba.csuohio.edu> was suggesting I remove the
  Escape character from my C code.  I disagreed...
+ Someone announced linux_logo-2.11 long before I thought it was ready
  to announce.  Please people, let me do the announcing....
+ Peter Magnusson <iocc@home.se> let me know that using "`" for a special
  character messes up the '-c' output.  Changed it to be "%".  Hopefully
  this will keep other problems from happening.
+ Audited all of the non-intel architectures.  Cleaned up and fixed a lot.
  Please let me know if anything else needs fixed.
+ Bundled up 2.12 for release.  Hope I don't make any mistakes...

8 November 1998
+ Added support for older 1.2.x kernels, thanks to Rusty Haddock 
  <rusty@fe2o3.lonestar.org>
+ Added code to print the MHz if given by the new tsc code in kernels
  >2.1.127
+ Actually finally release 2.12

5 December 1998
+ Idea from Juhapekka Tolvanen <juhtolv@silmu.st.jyu.fi> to totally
  re-write sysinfo stuff.  Will work on over break.
+ Also added sample scripts from him to contrib directory.
+ Pending re-write of entire sub-system, to break compatibilty?
  Linux_logo 3.0?
  
9 January 1999
+ Ugly snowy and icy weather has trapped me at home, giving me time for the
  re-write.
+ Rewrote much of linux_logo to use a new "Format" engine.  The old behavior
  is now a compatibility layer over the new code.
+ See the README on how to use the new -F option.
+ It's a big enough change to move the major number to 3.0.
+ Tested all the intel cpuinfo's I have.  Now to see what I can do about
  the other architectures.
+ Overhauled the documentation.
+ To paraphrase Alan Cox and TMBG:
  o/~ metalab.unc.edu was sunsite.unc.edu, 
      now it's metalab.unc.edu not sunsite.unc.edu
      So if you had a file at sunsite.unc.edu
      It'll be waiting at metalab o/~
+ Pressing Projects: add gnu-configure scripts and update the man page.
  Unfortunately I am unsure how to go about either of those.
+ Added a PowerPC SMP patch from Ryan Nielsen <ran@krazynet.com>

10 January 1999
+ Tried to fix things up for a beta release to freshmeat tomorrow
+ Went through bringing up all non-intel targets to code.
+ Added Megahertz printing for Alpha chips

25 March 1999
+ Finally had time to work on linux_logo again.  School has just been tough.
  This is my spring break so I grabbed some time to try to get beta2 and 
  eventually 3.00 stable out the door.
+ Thanks to Christian T. Steigies <cts@ap031.experimentalphysik.uni-kiel.de>
  for sending in a patch fixing m68k and making sure it works on Amiga.

26 March 1999
+ Implemented MIPS [decstation and SGI indy]
+ Got intel up to par.  Modularized it a bit.  Sorta detects K6-3's and
  all the various pentium versions right as far as I can tell.
+ Thanks to Greg Smith <mke2fs@adirondack-park.net> for sending a patch
  to fix pentium2 detection under 2.0.x.
+ Thanks to "Evert Meulie esq." <evert@royal.net> for Dutch number support.
+ tim <theaney@toadmail.toad.net> sent in some fixes for the README
+ Fixed the MHz to fudge a bit so 400Mhz chips are reported as that and
  not as 399Mhz or 401Mhz as /proc/cpuinfo might think they are.
+ Added the gpl COPYING file, since I've always said this was gpl'd but never
  included the license with it.
+ Tweaked SPARC and ALPHA a bit.. this version passes all of my sample proc
  files.. hopefully it will work just fine...
+ Pack it up and release to freshmeat.... here comes 3.0b2
