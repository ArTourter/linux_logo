8 JULY 1997
+ Came up with the Idea
+ Converted the logo.xpm file to ANSI using ppm2ansi and xv
+ Fixed up the picture with THEDRAW under DOSEMU 0.66.7
+ Combined into a C program using jed.

9 JULY 1997
+ Figured out the tricky proc stuff (very inelegant)
+ Released version 0.1

10 JULY 1997
+ Fixed it so it looks better on a white background (standard rxvt or xterm)
+ Released version 0.2
+ Added documentation on how to add a "penguin port" to telnet into

14 JULY 1997
+ Return for weekend to find lots of feedback on this program.
+ Started adding updates.
+ Cleaned up output routines, added SMP and Atari support, and cleaned
  up the code in general.
+ Added a command line options. -v (version) -h (help) and -n (turn off
  periods in the output)
+ Released version 0.4 to my website [0.3 was a never released minor bugfix]

15 JULY 1997
+ Start on version 0.5
+ Really start modularizing.  Decide to make it completely platform
  independent.

16 JULY 1997
+ Finished modularization
+ Added -o option to print with offset
+ Finished cross-platform support (with a lot of #ifdef s)
+ Added IRIX and Default UNIX outputs
+ Added -s option to skip bogomips check on non-Linux OS's
+ Released version 0.6

18 JULY 1997
+ Got improved Atari m68k Code from Christian Marillat
+ Removed extraneous ^[ combination from the ansi .h files
  (so a cat of the header file shows the picture)
+ Released version 1.0 at sunsite and my site (no there is no 0.7-0.9
  ... the improvements were so drastic I thought it deserved a full
  version number).

25 JULY 1997
+ Fixed some typos in the README (thanks to Esperandi)
+ Ran doc files through ispell .. i didn't realize it was that bad ;)
+ Fixed handling of the -o option when a number doesn't follow
  (before resulted in seg-fault). (thanks to Adam Lackorzynski) 
+ Re-released as version 1.01

4 AUGUST 1997
+ Worked some more on the -o problem (again many thanks to Adam Lackorzynski)
  should not give any more problems.

5 AUGUST 1997
+ Added a TODO file
+ Added an exit() call to the help section, and removed some return 1; s
+ Fixed a minor bug with SGI getcpuinfo.
+ Put version 1.02 at my site (for some reason I forgot to put 1.01 there)  

6 FEBRUARY 1998
+ A few extremely minor bugs/typos fixed over the past months.
+ Added better support for K6-chips [I recently upgraded to one ;)] and
  the newer kernels.
+ Package up version 1.04 and release for test to UM-LUG

11 FEBRUARY 1998
+ Added "plain ascii" penguin and -a option to display it.
  [thanks to <nelson@media.mit.edu>] for getting me started on this one.
+ Fixed URL in the -h option
+ Make appropriate updates
+ Added OpenLinux instructions to Readme [thanks to <heaney@zombie.ncsc.mil>]
+ Released 1.05

12 FEBRUARY 1998
+ Found bug in 1.05 [% signs not work well in /etc/issue.net  ... they are
  escaped... ugh] so released 1.06
+ UGH! Uploaded 1.06 as ASCII instead of BIN at sunsite by mistake.  Changed
  version of package to 1.07 but leave everything as 1.06 ;)  yes I'm lazy
  
19 FEBRUARY 1998
+ Added Cyrix 6x86 support [thanks to <adam@princeton.edu>]
+ Changed to read the vendor_id to report vendor.  Idea also thanks to 
  <adam@princeton.edu>
  
13 MARCH 1998
+ Added minimal AIX port [thanks to Thomas Grewe]
+ Added indredible Banner support!  "linux_logo -banner"
  Much thanks to Albert Lai <aylai@unixg.ubc.ca>
+ Also added "-rX" option to change the character in banner, and 
  "-w Num" which changes width [all under banner]  
+ Made old linux_logo look "linux_logo -classic"
+ Modularized the getsysinfo.c files.  Trying to follow all the #ifdef
  statements was getting confusing.
+ Included a nice "further info" file from Tony Nugent <T.Nugent@sct.gu.edu.au>
+ Bunch of other stuff to get ready for release
+ Released version 2.00

16 APRIL 1998
+ Finally had time to work on things again.
+ Thanks to Joerg Berg <joerg@joberg.snafu.de> linux-alpha support should
  work.
+ I also rearranged the "sysinfo.c" file.  It now relies on pre-processor
  magic, but simplified the Makefile a lot.
+ Zipped up version 2.0.1

13 May 1998
+ Fixed it so that command line paramaters were passed to the relevant
  modules.  This had been broken for some time; thanks to
  <mengmeng@earthling.net> for pointing this out.
+ The boot-logo flamewar has started on linux-kernel, so I think I will
  zip up and get 2.0.2 ready to announce....
