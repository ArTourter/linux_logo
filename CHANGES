8 JULY 1997
+ Came up with the Idea

9 JULY 1997

10 JULY 1997

14 JULY 1997
+ Return for weekend to find lots of feedback on this program.
+ Started adding updates.
+ Cleaned up output routines, added SMP and Atari support, and cleaned
  up the code in general.
+ Added a command line options. -v (version) -h (help) and -n (turn off
  periods in the output)
+ Released version 0.4 to my website [0.3 was a never released minor bugfix]

15 JULY 1997

+ Really start modularizing.  Decide to make it completely platform
  independent.

16 JULY 1997

+ Released version 0.6

18 JULY 1997
+ Got improved Atari m68k Code from Christian Marillat
+ Removed extraneous ^[ combination from the ansi .h files
  (so a cat of the header file shows the picture)
+ Released version 1.0 at sunsite and my site (no there is no 0.7-0.9
  ... the improvements were so drastic I thought it deserved a full
  version number).

25 JULY 1997
+ Fixed some typos in the README (thanks to Esperandi)
+ Ran doc files through ispell .. i didn't realize it was that bad ;)
+ Fixed handling of the -o option when a number doesn't follow
  (before resulted in seg-fault). (thanks to Adam Lackorzynski) 
+ Re-released as version 1.01

4 AUGUST 1997
+ Worked some more on the -o problem (again many thanks to Adam Lackorzynski)
  should not give any more problems.

5 AUGUST 1997
+ Added a TODO file
+ Added an exit() call to the help section, and removed some return 1; s
+ Fixed a minor bug with SGI getcpuinfo.
+ Put version 1.02 at my site (for some reason I forgot to put 1.01 there)  

6 FEBRUARY 1998
+ A few extremely minor bugs/typos fixed over the past months.
+ Added better support for K6-chips [I recently upgraded to one ;)] and
  the newer kernels.
