+ Completed the new, separate libsysinfo stuff, splitting it off
  from linux_logo
  
27 March 2001
+ Added minimal SunOS [Solaris] support.  It compiles and displays
  mostly empty strings.

+ You can do a "make shared" to get a .so linux shared library.
  It works, but I am sure it's not as robust as a shared lib
  should be.

30 April 2001
+ Fix from Matt <madmatt@bits.bris.ac.uk> so that linux-sparc cpuinfo
  will be compiled properly.

7 June 2001
+ Change to makefile so it doesn't depend on symlinks.  But instead
  it depends on "uname" existing.
